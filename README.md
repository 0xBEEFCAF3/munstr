## What is Munstr?
**Munstr** is a combination of Schnorr signature based **Musig** (multisignature) keys in a terminal based wallet using decentralized **Nostr** networks as a communication layer to facilitate a secure and encrypted method of transporting and digitally signing bitcoin transactions in a way that chain analysis cannot identify the nature and setup of the transaction data. To anyone observing the blockchain, Munstr transactions look like single key **Pay-to-Taproot** (P2TR) spends.

This is facilitated through an interactive, multi-signature (n-of-n) Bitcoin wallet that is designed to enable a group of signers to coordinate an interactive signing session for taproot based outputs that belong to an aggregated public key.

## Key Features

üåê **Open source** for anyone to use or to contribute to

üîê **Multisignature** keysets to reduce single key risk

üîÄ **Encrypted Communications** with Nostr decentralized events

üí™ **Taproot** supported outputs 


## Architecture
There are three major components to Munstr.

### Signer
The signer is responsible for using private keys in a multisignature keyset to digitally sign a **partially signed bitcoin transaction** (PSBT).

### Nostr
The Nostr decentralized network acts as a transport and communications layer for PSBT data. 

### Coordinator 
Coordinators act as a mediator between digital signers and wallets.  The coordinator facilitates digital signatures from each required (n-of-n) key signers and assists in broadcasting the fully signed transaction.

## Getting started

1. Start virtualenv `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Running the coordinator

1. Initialize the persistent storage: Create a `src/coordinator/db.json` file from the provided `db.template.json`.
    ```
    cp src/coordinator/db.template.json src/coordinator/db.json
    ```
2. Start the coordinator
    ```
    python3 start_coordinator.py
    ```

### Running a signer

`python3 start_signer.py`


## Standing on the shoulders of giants

In addition to the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`, this project also uses:

- Code from the Bitcoin Optech Taproot & Schnorr workshop, specifically the Python test framework. The `test_framework` folder has been brought into our project and renamed to `src/bitcoin`.

## Future goals

- MuSig 2 enhancements
- More accurate transaction fee estimation
- Better nostr encrypted DM support
- Custom nostr relay servers
- Custom nostr PSBT event types 
- Node connectivity
  - Sovereign TX lookup & broadcast
- Seed Phrases & xpubs
- Hardware Wallet support
  - SeedSigner (Taproot incoming)
  - Blockstream Jade
